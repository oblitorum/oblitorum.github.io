[{"content":"On version \u0026gt;= 1.12, Golang changes its way to handle HTTP request when you serve with ListenAndServeTLS method. The difference is shown on below image, which is taken from this link.\nAs we can see, on version \u0026lt; 1.12, it just returns without writing anything in response, which makes a \u0026lsquo;malformed HTTP response\u0026rsquo; error when you use Get or Client.Do with net/http package. And on version \u0026gt;= 1.12, it will return an 400 response with \u0026lsquo;Client sent an HTTP request to an HTTPS server.\u0026rsquo; message.\nSome third-party packages haven\u0026rsquo;t noticed this difference yet, they may use \u0026lsquo;malformed HTTP response\u0026rsquo; error to check if server setup TLS or not. For example, this one uses this way, it will cause a problem if the server is built with Golang version \u0026gt;= 1.12.\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["Golang"],"title":"Be Aware of How ListenAndServeTLS Handles Http Request on Golang net/http Package","uri":"https://oblitorum.github.io/posts/be-aware-of-how-listenandservetls-handles-http-request-on-golang-net-http-package/"},{"content":"Why am I still here, just to suffer. :)\n","description":"","id":1,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"Jason Ng","uri":"https://oblitorum.github.io/about/"}]
